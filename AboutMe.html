            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>  My interest for coding all started a couple of years ago, I was bored and decided to google, fun things to do when bored. 
             While on my search, someone mentioned to make a website.  That caught my interest and I became curious as to how exactly a
             website is made.  Through my research, I came across the object-oriented language, HTML and CSS.  From there, I found the website, CodeAcadamy.  
             If you don't know about CodeAcadamy I suggest you check the website out.  Once, I learned the basics and saw my output come to life, I was amazed at what I had
             created. 
            </p>
            <p> Now, thinking back I'm glad that I googled fun things to do when bored.  Since, then I have been coding for fun.  My hobbies
              are to code on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeAcadamy</a> or <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/">freeCodeCamp</a>, researching a topic of interest, and exercise. 
             I use many apps to code but my two main sites are the ones mentioned previously.  Researching a topic of interest is one of my favorite things to do.  
             The duration of my research last about a month. Some topics that I have conducted research on are finances, inspiration, self-improvement, and business. I enjoy seeking 
             knowledge.  I feel that once I graduate I will continue to seek knowledge until the end of my time.  During my busy schedule, 
             I try to squeeze in a workout 5 days a week.  I enjoy exercising as it relieves stress.
